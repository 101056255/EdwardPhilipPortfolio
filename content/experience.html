                                    This online weather app was built using React and the Open Weather API.
                                    It is a live updating application that shows the current weather in the
                                    Toronto Area.

                                    Development course. The application features a dynamic page which changes
                                    according to the weather at the current time. In this image, the image icon
                                    is showing a clear night sky.

                                    users to create hotels with unique ID's to be stored in MongoDB for the
                                    purposes of creating a booking system. Hotels, bookings and users are created

                                    The Restaurant Guide android application is a simple introduction into using
                                    Android Studio. The basis of the app is to allow users to create a dynamic list
                                    of restaurants which can be added and removed by the user.

                                    with more detail about the restaurant. This includes the restaurant name, address,
                                    phone number, description and tags which are all entered in by the user. A Google Maps
                                    view is also included on the page using the address inserted by the user to mark the
                                    location of the restaurant allowing the user to seamlessly find the directions

                                    This is an example of the splash screen used in the application. From this point on
                                    it would be use as my point of reference to monitor the progress in the development of
                                    my skills in Android Studio and mobile application design. Many of the features within this
                                    app are to be featured in The Stray No More Capstone project.
